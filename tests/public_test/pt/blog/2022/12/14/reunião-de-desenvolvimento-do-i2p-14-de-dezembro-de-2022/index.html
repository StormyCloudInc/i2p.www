<div class="irc-log"> (08:00:09 PM) eyedeekay: Hello everyone, welcome to the rescheduled dev meeting (08:00:09 PM) eyedeekay: 1. Hi  (08:00:09 PM) eyedeekay: 2. 2.0.0 Release Status, 2.0.0 Mac Release Status  (08:00:09 PM) eyedeekay: 3. 2.1.0 Development Status  (08:00:09 PM) eyedeekay: 4. Stickers for Translators (08:00:50 PM) zzz: hi (08:02:55 PM) eyedeekay: Doesn't seem like he's here? going to move along for now. (08:04:04 PM) eyedeekay: 2. 2.0.0 release status: *most* targets of 2.0.0 were released about 3 weeks ago now, including i2p.i2p, Android, Debian and Easy-Install Windows, with Easy-Install for Mac delayed by zlatinb's departure (08:04:04 PM) eyedeekay: Ech and I have been working on a plan to replace him in terms of maintenance, signing, and notarization of the OSX bundle, that is still expected for close to the end of this month (08:06:01 PM) eyedeekay: Everybody knows how to build everything, has a good idea of the signing requirements, the last remaining thing to do is notarization in practice, and we don't know everything we should expect here but I think we have a good idea (08:07:10 PM) eyedeekay: Android needed a point release due to a bug related to compatibility with a new API on newer devices, so Android users should make sure they've upgraded to 2.0.1 (08:07:10 PM) eyedeekay: eot for me on 2, anything to add zzz (08:07:20 PM) zzz: lots (08:07:50 PM) uis is now known as Irc2PGuest69907 (08:08:04 PM) zzz: I had to release a 2.0.0-2ubunutu1 debian/ubuntu build to fix an embarrassing but ultimately harmless bunch of stray symlinks in root (08:08:38 PM) zzz: root cause was a typo, deb lint didn't catch it, not sure what the post mortem lesson is other than be more careful, we're root on install... (08:09:12 PM) zzz: as far as the network, after 3 weeks, half of it has updated and is using ssu2 (08:09:39 PM) zzz: exploratory build success has been trending straight down since the release (08:09:56 PM) zzz: we're concerned, and monitoring closely (08:10:47 PM) zzz: at this point we think it's some combination of ssu-to-ssu2 migration, ssu2 bugs on both our side and in i2pd, and a couple of routers that are spamming the network with tunnel builds (08:11:05 PM) zzz: i2pd is considering a mid-cycle january point release to get their fixes out (08:11:33 PM) zzz: for now I don't think that's necessary on our side but it's always an option should we choose to (08:12:18 PM) zzz: I think that's EOT but I'll have more info in a moment as a part of 3) (08:13:09 PM) eyedeekay: Thank you zzz (08:13:43 PM) eyedeekay: 3. 2.1.0 Development Status (08:17:12 PM) eyedeekay: We're 3 weeks in to this cycle, in this time I've been working on getting Android migrated fully over to the modern gradle plugin, I stopped short of migrating from maven to maven-push before release, after that, what's on the list for Android is orbot-style split tunneling for configuring apps without a proxy(Sort of the Android version of torsocks) (08:17:12 PM) eyedeekay: For desktop I've been working on getting our integration into Whonix fixed and have been work related to getting the Easy-Install for Windows out of beta (08:18:43 PM) eyedeekay: That's what I'm working on, zzz would you like to continue with your information or 3)? (08:19:43 PM) dr|z3d: ... intermission ... (08:23:56 PM) anonymousmaybe is now known as Irc2PGuest40130 (08:24:03 PM) eyedeekay: Welcome back (08:25:17 PM) eyedeekay: What was the last thing you got? (08:26:28 PM) zzz: back (08:26:28 PM) zzz: is it my turn yet? :) (08:26:28 PM) dr|z3d: you need to put on an apron and wheel the confectionery tray around the theater :) (08:26:28 PM) dr|z3d: did you go out to get us all ice cream? :) (08:26:28 PM) dr|z3d: recap: (08:26:28 PM) dr|z3d: &lt;eyedeekay&gt; We're 3 weeks in to this cycle, in this time I've been working on getting Android migrated fully over to the modern gradle plugin, I stopped short of migrating from maven to maven-push before release, after that, what's on the list for Android is orbot-style split tunneling for configuring apps without a proxy(Sort of the Android version of torsocks) (08:26:28 PM) dr|z3d: &lt;eyedeekay&gt; For desktop I've been working on getting our integration into Whonix fixed and have been work related to getting the Easy-Install for Windows out of beta (08:26:28 PM) dr|z3d: &lt;eyedeekay&gt; That's what I'm working on, zzz would you like to continue with your information or 3)? (08:26:48 PM) zzz: thanks (08:27:04 PM) zzz: drz gave it to me (08:27:12 PM) zzz: ok, my turn! (08:27:33 PM) zzz: about a week and a half after the release, when a lot of the net had updated, I started chasing SSU2 problems (08:27:42 PM) zzz: and found a whole lot (08:27:56 PM) zzz: both ours and helped i2pd find some of theirs (08:27:58 PM) zzz: so it's been quite busy (08:28:14 PM) zzz: as a result, we're at almost 7000 lines of diff, more than the whole 2.0.0 release (08:28:38 PM) zzz: and whatever else I had planned for 2.1.0 I haven't gotten to yet, including promised peer selection improvements (08:29:50 PM) zzz: I plan to bump to -7 after the meeting (08:29:50 PM) zzz: while the "big changes in" deadline is early January, let's stay flexible, as we don't want a bunch of WIP in there if we're going to do a 2.0.1 release (08:29:59 PM) zzz: so let's try not to break things with "big changes" if possible. Big changes are fine, as long as they're isolated (08:30:40 PM) zzz: but things are going well and we're working closely with i2pd to track down and fix issues (08:31:02 PM) zzz: including one-in-a-million ones that are now popping up (08:31:16 PM) zzz: and one-in-a-zillion ones that dr|z3d is finding on his high speed routers (08:31:30 PM) zzz: that's it! EOT, any questions? (08:32:27 PM) eyedeekay: I'm slightly curious how often a "Million" of some things happens in in the real world but possibly a question for another time (08:33:17 PM) eyedeekay: Thanks zzz (08:34:12 PM) eyedeekay: It seems like once you get a whole bunch of routers doing a thing the odds of a rare event happening somewhere would go up very fast (08:35:11 PM) zzz: yeah. perhaps we should have been more cautious, and not go from 2% to 100% in one release. But we'll get through it (08:35:17 PM) uis is now known as Irc2PGuest38853 (08:37:15 PM) eyedeekay: 4. Stickers for Translators (08:37:15 PM) eyedeekay: Only real news here is that I now have stickers for mailing, I've got a ton of them so if you're in the Americas then I am prepared to mail them (08:37:58 PM) zzz: would you please post something on my forum, saying who is eligible and how to request (08:38:17 PM) eyedeekay: Can do (08:38:29 PM) zzz: then I will copy paste over to transifex announcement (08:38:48 PM) zzz: what's the status of the euro side? (08:39:44 PM) eyedeekay: Don't know if he has his yet, will request an update from him tonight (08:40:07 PM) zzz: ok, guess I need to wait for that part of it before transifex (08:40:43 PM) zzz: please whack him with your baffer for making us reschedule and then not showing :) (08:41:07 PM) eyedeekay: Well it was my fault too but I'll make sure to let him know :) (08:41:32 PM) zzz: I mean yesterday to today. you're not off the hook for last week :) (08:42:41 PM) eyedeekay: That's all I've got for 4 and/or today, anything else for the meeting? (08:42:50 PM) zzz: nope (08:43:02 PM) zzz: are we on or off for Jan. 3? (08:44:26 PM) eyedeekay: All right then thanks zzz for coming, I was going to say "On" for Jan 3 but we could do the 10th instead since IIRC LS2 will be the 9th (08:45:01 PM) zzz: doesn't matter, your call (08:45:35 PM) eyedeekay: Let's have it on the 9th in January and return to first-Tuesday in February (08:45:52 PM) zzz: you mean 10th? (08:45:59 PM) eyedeekay: Yes the 10th (08:46:07 PM) zzz: ok (08:46:15 PM) zzz: meeting over? (08:46:25 PM) eyedeekay: Yes </div>
