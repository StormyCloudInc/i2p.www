      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to share important news: StormyCloud is officially joining forces with I2P in a significant way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years, StormyCloud has been a critical part of I2P&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, providing hosting and support that keeps the network running smoothly. Now we&amp;rsquo;re formalizing that partnership and expanding what we can do together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re particularly glad to announce that Lance James and idk are joining StormyCloud&amp;rsquo;s Board of Directors. Lance founded the Invisible Internet Project, which evolved into what we now know as I2P, and his experience building privacy-focused networks goes back decades. idk has been extensively involved in I2P development for years — if you use I2P, you&amp;rsquo;ve benefited from his work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
