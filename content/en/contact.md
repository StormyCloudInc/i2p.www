## Forums {#forums}

Please visit our I2P user forum - [i2pforum.i2p](http://i2pforum.i2p/) (available on non-private internet at https://i2pforum.net and on I2P at http://i2pforum.i2p)

The discussion about I2P's development happens on the [I2P user forum](http://i2pforum.i2p). This is usually the best place to start with developer inquiries, if the dev IRC channel is inactive. For general support use either the [I2P user forum](http://i2pforum.i2p) or the Subreddit.

## Social Media {#social}

## IRC {#irc}

Our primary IRC network is the Irc2P network within I2P; a default tunnel to this network is set up with new router installs. We are also present on multiple standard networks like [OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/oftc/OFTC), [EIN](http://www.einirc.de/) and [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/). All I2P-related channels on all these networks are linked to the main channels on Irc2P via relay bots.

**Channel list:**

```
#i2p       - General i2p discussion and help channel
#i2p-chat  - Offtopic
#i2p-dev   - Development talk
```

## Mailing Lists

I2P has no active mailing lists, however archives can be accessed.

## Inclusion

I2P welcomes all kinds of people, as long as they are friendly and helpful to each other.

The I2P router software was created in this spirit and should be used to help repressed people to regain their freedom of speech, while not suppressing others.
