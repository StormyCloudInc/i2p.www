Translation is an ongoing process, and contributions of any size are valuable.\n\n## Translation Platform\n\nWe use **Transifex** for all I2P translations. This is the easiest and recommended method for both new and experienced translators.\n\n### Getting Started with Transifex\n\n1. **Create an account** at [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/)\n2. **Join the I2P project**: [I2P on Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/otf/I2P/)\n3. **Request to join** your language team (or request a new language if not listed)\n4. **Start translating** once approved\n\n### Why Transifex?\n\n- **User-friendly interface** - No technical knowledge required\n- **Translation memory** - Suggests translations based on previous work\n- **Collaboration** - Work with other translators in your language\n- **Quality control** - Review process ensures accuracy\n- **Automatic updates** - Changes sync with the development team\n\n## What to Translate\n\n### Router Console (Priority)\n\nThe I2P router console is the primary interface users interact with when running I2P. Translating it has the most immediate impact on user experience.\n\n**Key areas to translate:**\n\n- **Main interface** - Navigation, menus, buttons, status messages\n- **Configuration pages** - Settings descriptions and options\n- **Help documentation** - Built-in help files and tooltips\n- **News and updates** - Initial news feed shown to users\n- **Error messages** - User-facing error and warning messages\n- **Proxy configurations** - HTTP, SOCKS, and tunnel setup pages\n\nAll router console translations are managed through Transifex in `.po` (gettext) format.\n\n## Translation Guidelines\n\n### Style and Tone\n\n- **Clear and concise** - I2P deals with technical concepts; keep translations simple\n- **Consistent terminology** - Use the same terms throughout (check translation memory)\n- **Formal vs. informal** - Follow conventions for your language\n- **Preserve formatting** - Keep placeholders like `{0}`, `%s`, `<b>tags</b>` intact\n\n### Technical Considerations\n\n- **Encoding** - Always use UTF-8 encoding\n- **Placeholders** - Do not translate variable placeholders (`{0}`, `{1}`, `%s`, etc.)\n- **HTML/Markdown** - Preserve HTML tags and Markdown formatting\n- **Links** - Keep URLs unchanged unless there's a localized version\n- **Abbreviations** - Consider whether to translate or keep original (e.g., \"KB/s\", \"HTTP\")\n\n### Testing Your Translations\n\nIf you have access to an I2P router:\n\n1. Download the latest translation files from Transifex\n2. Place them in your I2P installation\n3. Restart the router console\n4. Review the translations in context\n5. Report any issues or improvements needed\n\n## Getting Help\n\n### Community Support\n\n- **IRC Channel**: `#i2p-dev` on I2P IRC or OFTC\n- **Forum**: I2P development forums\n- **Transifex Comments**: Ask questions directly on translation strings\n\n### Common Questions\n\n**Q: How often should I translate?**\nTranslate at your own pace. Even translating a few strings helps. The project is ongoing.\n\n**Q: What if my language isn't listed?**\nRequest a new language on Transifex. If there's demand, the team will add it.\n\n**Q: Can I translate alone or need a team?**\nYou can start alone. As more translators join your language, you can collaborate.\n\n**Q: How do I know what needs translation?**\nTransifex shows completion percentages and highlights untranslated strings.\n\n**Q: What if I disagree with an existing translation?**\nSuggest improvements in Transifex. Reviewers will evaluate changes.\n\n## Advanced: Manual Translation (Optional)\n\nFor experienced translators who want direct access to source files:\n\n### Requirements\n\n- **Git** - Version control system\n- **POEdit** or text editor - For editing `.po` files\n- **Basic command line** knowledge\n\n### Process\n\n1. **Clone the repository**:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://i2pgit.org/i2p-hackers/i2p.i2p.git\n   ```\n\n2. **Find translation files**:\n   - Router console: `apps/routerconsole/locale/`\n   - Look for `messages_xx.po` (where `xx` is your language code)\n\n3. **Edit translations**:\n   - Use POEdit or a text editor\n   - Save with UTF-8 encoding\n\n4. **Test locally** (if you have I2P installed)\n\n5. **Submit changes**:\n   - Create a merge request on [I2P Git](https://i2pgit.org/)\n   - Or share your `.po` file with the development team\n\n**Note**: Most translators should use Transifex. Manual translation is only for those comfortable with Git and development workflows.\n\n## Thank You\n\nEvery translation helps make I2P more accessible to users worldwide. Whether you translate a few strings or entire sections, your contribution makes a real difference in helping people protect their privacy online.\n\n**Ready to start?** [Join I2P on Transifex \u2192](https://explore.transifex.com/otf/I2P/)\n"}], "max_tokens": 4000}}
